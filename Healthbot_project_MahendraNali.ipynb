Some tests may be necessary if the cause of the fever is not clear after your doctor has taken a medical history and performed an examination. These tests may include:\\n\\n blood tests\\n urine examination and culture\\n throat swabs or mucus sample examination and culture\\n stool examination and culture\\n x-rays.\\n\\n## Treatment options\\n\\nTreatment depends on the cause – for example, chronic tonsillitis may require surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy). [...] Suggestions to treat fever include:\\n\\n Take paracetamol or ibuprofen in appropriate doses to help bring your temperature down.\\n Drink plenty of fluids, particularly water.\\n Avoid alcohol, tea and coffee as these drinks can cause slight dehydration.\\n Sponge exposed skin with tepid water. To boost the cooling effect of evaporation, you could try standing in front of a fan.\\n Avoid taking cold baths or showers. Skin reacts to the cold by constricting its blood vessels, which will trap body heat. The cold may also cause shivering, which can generate more heat.\\n Make sure you have plenty of rest, including bed rest.\\n\\n## When to see your doctor for fever symptoms\\n\\nYou should always consult with your doctor in the following cases: [...] You are still feverish after 3 days, despite home treatment.\\n Your temperature is over 40°C.\\n You are shivering and shaking involuntarily, or your teeth are chattering.\\n You seem to be getting sicker as time goes by.\\n You have unusual symptoms such as hallucinations, vomiting, neck stiffness, skin rash, rapid heart rate, chills or muscle spasms.\\n You feel confused and drowsy.\\n You have a severe headache that doesn’t respond to painkillers.\\n You have recently travelled overseas.\\n\\n## When to seek immediate urgent medical attention\\n\\nYou should seek immediate medical attention if you or someone else has the following symptoms:\",\n",
